## 名字来源

本来想叫：“码匠”，意为编码之工匠，因为这个名字已经被其他公司使用，所以换为：“码札”，札有书信、笔记之意

## About

This is the official Wails Svelte-TS template.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
